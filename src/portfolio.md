### Services:

I build websites. My sites are simple, designed to be mobile friendly, and reflective of the client's content. Since I am still launching myself as a freelancer, I promise to charge less than the easy to use website builders.
I have experience building (but am by no means limited to):

1. photo gallery
1. blog
1. ecommerce site
