## reasons:

1. There is nothing else to do
1. This is cheaper than therapy

Like so many people around the globe, I lost my job and sense of a career from Covid-19. It started as a mad panic induced by late nights and copious booze, but then it settled into a stark new reality. On one of those sobbering mornings, I decided to actually put an effort into something again. I should preface by saying the idea of learning happened on a late night, drinking straight whisky with my roommate who's a dev. He introduced the idea as a way to collaborate and create a RPG through a powerful JS library, Phaser.js.

A few weeks passed from the inception, and I realized javascript wasn't that wasy. I put down the idea that I was ready to collaborate on a project and set to learn the foundamentals. It started off with a few classes on freecodecamp and udemey. Eventually I got decent roadmap of where I'd like to be and what type of projects I'd need to be "job ready". The whole time I stuggled desperately with a few things:

1. Should I enroll in a $20,000 bootcamp?
1. Is it too late to switch careers?
1. Shouldn't I do something involving community activism?

## new reality:

Apart from a steady and daily existenial breakdown, my life is very sedintary. I wake up, work on coding, whether its new tech or trying to do an actual project. It usually starts on the desk where I go until breakfast, then it's too the couch with the laptop on my lap, and finally I become fully reclined on the couch, laptop on the belly, with TV distracting me in the background. Isn't this what we're suppose to do right night now? I'd like to say that if Covid wan't in the equation, I would go in for a more traditional learning enviornment, in person. But the truth is, I didn't have the motivation before loosing my job. Another truth is I like learning at my own pace on the comfort of my couch. It isn't permanent for me, but it could also be a hell of a lot worse.
